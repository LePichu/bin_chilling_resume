It all began when I was just **11 years old**. My sister introduced me to the world of photography by bringing a camera home, igniting a spark of curiosity within me. Rather than her interest fizzling out, it only fueled my own passion for capturing moments. Around the same time, back at school, a few friends and I dabbled in creating comics, sparking a newfound passion for storytelling and visual expression. To accommodate our creative endeavors, I delved into the world of **graphic design**, teaching myself the ropes and crafting digital art right from my phone. Concurrently, as I pursued programming, I found myself drawn to the world of **UI Designing** and **UX**, recognizing the symbiotic relationship between programming and user experience. Over the years, I've honed my skills using tools like *Photo Editor by dev.macgyer* and Adobe's suite of software, including *Photoshop*, for both artistic endeavors and heavy editing work. Additionally, I've ventured into the realm of **pixel art** with *Aseprite*, and explored video editing using *DaVinci Resolve*, *VN*, and *Kinemaster*, transforming raw footage into captivating visual narratives.
