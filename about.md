Hey there, I'm *Ishat Gupta*, just a **17-year-old** who's been dancing with computers since the age of **3**. It's like they were my playmates, you know? **Graphics design**, **photography**, and **programming** became my jam when I was just **11**. My first Programming Language crush was *Java*, but nowadays, I'm head over heels for *Rust*, *TypeScript*, and *PowerShell*. There's something about their elegance and power that just speaks to me. I am also a prominent consumer of *open-source* software, but I also love to give back by contributing to them. Speaking of unconventional, I do a lot of things on my phone – I turned it into a pocket Swiss army knife for programming and editing needs. It's like carrying a whole workshop in my pocket, ready to unleash creativity wherever I go. When I'm not lost in lines of code or pixels, you'll find me behind a camera lens, capturing the beauty of nature and people. But I don't stop there – I love to take those pictures and turn them into abstract art, playing with colors and shapes to create something entirely new and unexpected.
