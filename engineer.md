From my **first mesmerizing encounter** with my father's laptop at the tender age of 3, technology has been my constant companion and passion. Over the past **14 years**, I've delved into the intricacies of all **five major operating systems** _(Windows, macOS, Linux, Android & iOS)_, eagerly exploring new frontiers like Google's Fuchsia project. Along the way, I've immersed myself in the world of **programming**, honing my skills and now embarking on the ambitious journey of crafting my own **programming language and operating system** for research purposes. This **lifelong journey as a developer** has been both exhilarating and rewarding, fueling my thirst for innovation and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. I am currently active in researching and partaking in **Programming Language Development**, **Operating System Development** and looking into more usecases for **WebAssembly**.
